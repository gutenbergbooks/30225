<h2>VIS ULTIMA</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is no day but leads me to<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A peak impossible to scale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A task at which my hands must fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sea I cannot swim or sail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no night I suffer thro<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Destiny rules stern and pale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet what I am meant to do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will do, ere Death drop his veil.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And it shall be no little thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho to oblivion it fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I shall strive to it thro all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That can imperil or appal.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So at each morning's trumpet-ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mount again, less slave and thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the barriers gladly fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fortitude that scorns to crawl.<br /></span>

<h2>MEREDITH</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What am I reading? He is dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He the great interpreter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seer&mdash;England's noblest head?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What am I reading? It is hushed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deepest voice that life had found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To read a century profound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all time's seethe and stir?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why, it is but a scanty score<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of days, since, at his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasping his hand with more than pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I felt that the immortal tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his great mind would long break o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cold command of Death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still in my ear is echoing<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The surf of his strong words, and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the wild trees on the Hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cottage sheltered under,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see the toss of his gray locks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Lear's&mdash;for he had felt the sting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all too greatly giving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kingdom of his mind to those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who for it held him mad.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O England, guard thy living<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him from a like fate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not the mighty thunder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy proud name from all the rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the world can compensate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nation whom no Song makes glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whom no Seer makes great.<br /></span>
